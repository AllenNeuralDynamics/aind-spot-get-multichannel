# aind-spot-get-multichannel

Repository that computes statistics of ZYX spots in different channels. This is helpful for spot demixing. E.g., a dataset with 4 channels where we have all the ZYX locations of spots.
    - spots_ch0.npy, spots_ch1.npy, spots_ch2.npy, spots_ch3.npy.

For channel 0, we need to get statistics in all the ZYX locations from ch1, ch2, and ch3.
